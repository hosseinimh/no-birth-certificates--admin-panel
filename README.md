# Admin panel for registering no-birth-certificate students as well as their parents or relatives

## Brief
This project is deigned by `Laravel` as backend and `React.js` as frontend. `MySql` is used for storing data. Before registering no-birth-certificate students in schools, they must have an official letter, which is written down their names and parents. Its good to have a database of such students and their family. On the other hand the number of these students are a lot and issuing an official letter for that is routine so I decided to create a website for it.
